# -Student-Performance-Prediction

Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting students' exam scores based on the number of study hours and other factors. Using a dataset containing information about students’ study habits and exam performance, the goal is to visualize the relationship between study hours and exam scores and build a predictive model using machine learning techniques.

Problem Statement
The problem is to predict a student's exam score based on how many hours they studied. This project uses a linear regression model to make predictions and visualize the correlation between study time and the resulting score.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries:
pandas
seaborn
matplotlib
scikit-learn
Install the required libraries using:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

Study Hours: The number of hours a student studied.
Exam Score: The score the student achieved on the exam.


Output
The output includes:

Scatter Plot: Showing the relationship between study hours and exam scores.
Regression Line: Displaying the predicted relationship on top of the actual data.
Evaluation Metrics: MSE and R² scores that indicate how well the model performs.
Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how study hours influence exam scores using a linear regression model. By visualizing the data and using machine learning, we can make reasonably accurate predictions for students' exam performance based on the number of hours they studied.
